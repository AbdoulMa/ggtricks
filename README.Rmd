# ggtricks

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

{ggtricks} package is a collection of multiple geom  presenting data in the form of  circle (at the moment, but many more to come and not only circle oriented.) using grammar of graphics philosophy and Cartesian coordinates system.

You have bench of functions to make sector charts where  circle is divided along it radii,
so each section is proportional to value it represents.

* `geom_pie` Pie charts 
* `geom_donut` Donut charts (Pie chart with a hole)
* `geom_slice` Part of Pie charts
* `geom_donut_slice` Part of Donut charts 

You also have a function, `geom_series_circles()` to draw what I call series of circles, which  draws for a category as many circles and fraction of circles needed to represent the value represented by this category. A companion function `geom_series_text` is defined to put labels at limit of series circles as computing this limits positions can be tedious depending on fragments of circles starting angle.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ggtricks like so:

``` r
install.packages("ggtricks")
# or 
devtools::install_github("abdoulma/ggtricks")
```

## Examples 

###  `geom_series_circles`

- Two  series of circles combination

###  `geom_pie`

- Example with labels 
- Labels with ticks 

###  `geom_donut`

###  `geom_slice`

###  `geom_donut_slice`

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ggtricks)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.

## Limitations

As you surely noted, to generate circle, I use `coord_equal()`, using `coord_cartesian()` will  zoom the plot, not generating a appealing circle shape even if the underlying drawn plot is a plot. So, we fix, the `aspect ratio` to force :

> the physical representation of data units on the axes.

according to the official [documentation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/coord_fixed.html). 
Of course, you shouldn't edit the default `ratio = 1` that ensures that one unit on `x-axis` is the same length as one unit on the `y-axis`.

When using `geom_serie_circle()`, the desire will come one day to combine it with `facet_wrap()` or `facet_grid` or whatever faceting function, **you should not**, or not in the way you are thinking about.

As we use `coord_equal()`, you won't be able to set `scales` parameter, what I strongly suspect you to try to do. So for the moment, I don't recommend you to do so.
Although, I give some tips to go through those restrictions on package website <https://www.abdoulma.github.io/ggtricks>

## Roadmap

Detach spotlighted category
Variate radius for categories representation
Label displaying in mapping (choose category we want to display)
Special key draw for pie and slices and another one for donut and donut_slice
